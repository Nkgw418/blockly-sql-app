# SQL Blockly App
We (SPE Systemhaus Gmbh) developed a Blockly SQL Workspace, so that anyone can use this visual code editor and generate SQL Statements. Therefore new blocks were created to build these SQL Statements. A transformation from SQL Statements into SQL Blocks is possible, too. For this purpose we developed a SQL Parser which parses the statements and create a Blockly XML to load it into the workspace. You can play on our Demo Workspace on [https://sql.spe-systemhaus.de/].

## Goal
The goal is giving people, with less knowledge of SQL, the ability to develop their own SQL Statements. Our audience are managers and housewives.

## Usage 
Feel free to use the SQL Workspace in your project, this project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 License.

## Requirements
The Google Blockly Library [https://github.com/google/blockly] is required, to use the SQL Workspace. You can download the actual release from this link: [https://github.com/google/blockly/zipball/master] or use the version I pushed into this repository. If you want to use the compressed version from the download, you have to build this version by your own, because the date picker is commented and only if you need it you can comment this line out. So you have to go into the file "core/blockly.js" and comment the line with the following code `goog.require('Blockly.FieldDate');` out or use the version in the libs folder of this repository. 

PHP is required, additionally. Watch out: PHP 5.6 has a problem with ODBC connections !!! So you can't update or add ODBC connections to load the tables to the Blockly Workspace. 

## Requirements for development
If you want to start developing on this project, you need to install:
* Git [https://git-scm.com/]
* NodeJS [https://nodejs.org/]
* Bower [https://bower.io/] type `npm install -g bower`
* Grunt [http://gruntjs.com/] type `npm install -g grunt`

By using Bower all requirements will be fetched that are required for production and development. You only have to do the following steps, initially:
1. `git clone https://github.com/SPE-Systemhaus/blockly-sql-app.git` -> Cloning repository
2. `npm install` -> Getting all Grunt dependencies
3. `bower update` -> Getting all Bower dependencies

For developing you can use the following commands:
* `grunt parser` -> Generates the Parser from the Grammar located in "src/parser/SQLGrammar.jison" into the build folder
* `grunt debug` -> Building SQL Workspace for debugging without concating the needed modules from the common folder in the build folder
* `grunt` or `grunt release` -> Create a release version with concating all modules from the common folder generate min version and min map file in dist folder

For building Blockly by yourself you have todo two things:
* Go to file "../common/modules/GoogleBlockly/core/blockly.js" and comment out this line `goog.require('Blockly.FieldDate');` because Date fields are used in the Workspace.
* Python [https://www.python.org/]

## Connecting with a database
To use the SQL Blockly App with a real database, you have to use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity). Create a ODBC Connection to your Database. If the connection is established you can add the connection into the SQL Blockly Workspace. For configuring for Windows see the following technet article: 
* via PowerShell: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh771022(v=wps.630).aspx
* via GUI: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc879308(v=sql.105).aspx

## Parser
The Parser is generated with the help of the Jison Parser Generator [https://zaa.ch/jison/]. We created a grammar that can parse a set of SQL Statements which are relevant for SQL Newbies. In the folder docs of this repository a syntax diagram is located, which you can open in a webbrowser to get an overview of the developed "SQL Grammar for Newbies". Preferably we tried to develop a generic Grammar which fits to MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle SQL, DB2 SQL, ... No Joins are supported.

## Structure

### backend (PHP)
* The three functions addDataSource, getDataSource and removeDataSource are located here
* Handles the ODBC connections and saving the DB structure into the database folder

### doc
* You find here a syntax diagram for the developed grammar as a xhtml file ... Generated by Raildroad Diagram Generator [http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui]
* There is a text file which a cleaned grammar for the Railroad Diagram Generator

### help
* Location of the help files
* At the moment only english help

### lang
* The language files will be stored here 
* At the moment we support the languages English and German.

### database
* Here are the database structures of the over ODBC connected databases stored. These files will be saved here while adding or updating an ODBC connection and will be loaded. So you do not have permanent connection to your database.

### src
* Parser
    * Has the SQL Grammar, which will be used to generate the parser with the help of Jison
    * Location of the SQLXML class, which will be used to generate the Blockly XML to load this XML Dom into the Blockly Workspace
* Blocks
    * Design and Behaviour of the block categories
* Generator
    * Implementation of the SQL Blockly Generator
* constants.js
    * Holds some global variables in the SQLBlockly namespace
* exceptions.js
    * All own implemented exceptions are located in this file
* Language.js
    * Holds some functions to change and update the language files
    * The language files will be loaded, dynamically
* main.js
    * Starting point of the application is in the main() function, which is called onloading the body
* SQLHelper.js
    * Has some help functions for generating the blocks
